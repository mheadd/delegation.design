# Design Patterns for Delegation-based Digital Services

A website showcasing design patterns for delegation-based interactions between citizens and government services.

## About

This project presents four essential design pattern categories for government agencies preparing for delegation-based public services:

1. **Delegation Boundary Establishment** - Help citizens establish appropriate autonomy boundaries
2. **Asynchronous Action Communication** - Transparent reporting of actions taken offline  
3. **Cross-System Navigation** - Visibility when agents coordinate across government boundaries
4. **Trust and Verification** - Complete transparency about agent capabilities and limitations

## Technology

- React 18 with Vite
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Lucide React for icons
- Responsive design optimized for government services

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## Background

These design patterns are technology-agnostic and address fundamental challenges of delegation relationships between citizens and government, regardless of the underlying AI technology maturity.
